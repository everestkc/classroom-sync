# Classroom Sync Suite
These are a collection of tools for working with GitHub Classroom assignments.  

### Classroom Sync (Canvas)
This tool pulls a list of students from a Canvas course, then uses the provided roster.csv file to map the the Canvas user names to github user names. It then retrieves student repositories for the specified assignment and renames them to include Canvas username instead of their GitHub username.

```
Usage: classroom-sync.py <assignment> 
    assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
```

### Classroom Sync (Basic)
The original version of this tool did not have a dependency upon Canvas and instead the flow is simply for each entry in the roster.csv file, retrieve the student repository for the specified assignment and rename it to use the institution username from the mapping.  

```
Usage: classroom-sync-basic.py <assignment> 
    assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
```

### Commit and Push Grades (Canvas)
This tool will commit and push GRADE.md files, located within student repositories, to GitHub.  It first connects to Canvas to retrieve the student roster. For each student it then opens the local repo in the specified assignment folder and stages (adds) each GRADE.md to a single commit which is then pushed to GitHub. Since it is possible for a single repositories to contain multiple coding projects, multiple GRADE.md files may be found and pushed to GitHub for a single repository.

While not strictly necessay, by using the Canvas roster this tool can display info regarding students who not not have a local repository or who do not have a GitHub mapping. This can be helpful for debugging purposes or for razing the visibility of students who are not completing the assignments.

NOTE:  This tool is designed to be used on student repositories that have previousoly been cloned from GitHub using the classroom-sync.py tool described above.

```
Usage: commit-and-push-grades.py <assignment> 
    assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
```

## Before using this tool, do the following:
1. Set up SSH key-based authentication with GitHub  
2. Download the classroom_roster.csv file from GitHub Classroom  
3. Update classroom-config.json with the details for your classroom  
4. Enable API access for Canvas user account and store token in OS keyring. Details are provided below

## Installation Notes
This tool requires python3.8 and the pip utility as well as the following python modules:
```
pip install canvasapi
pip install keyring
```

## Canvas API Notes
Instead of embedding the canvas token, I am using the python keyring library to integrate with the operating systems keystore.  Once the python modules are installed, use the following command-line options to add the required values to the OS level keystore.  

To create an Access Token in Canvas do the following:

- Go to Account, Settings, New Access Token with reason â€œTo Synchronize Github Classrooms and Grades"

```
keyring set canvas token
# set password to the following:  <dev token from Canvas>
```

## Development Notes
This code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 running Python 3.8.10
